+ Clone this repo aka download as zip

# Notes

If the desired date or time are not available, you have 10 seconds to manually click antoher slot. Than wait for the script to continue.

The script does not book the appointment. You allways have to click on "Termin buchen" manually.

This script does not make sense at all, since the appointment is reserved for 20min after selecting it.
