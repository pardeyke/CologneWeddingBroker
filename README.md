# CologneWeddingBroker

If you ever want to marry your partner in the city of Cologne (KÃ¶ln) and need it to happen on certain day, this script may help you get the desired appointment. Be warned: This is not intended for someone who is not familiar with the terms console or ruby.

Also this is much easier to use on a Mac (Linux, Unix) and will for now not provide instructions for Windows.

# How to use

+ install Chrome
+ install ruby (ask Google or ChatGPT)
+ Clone this repo aka download as zip
+ cd into the folder and run bundle or install capybara gem manually
+ open wedding.rb and fill in the first row with your information
+ in terminal run ruby wedding.rb

# Notes

If the desired date or time are not available, you have 10 seconds to manually click another slot. Then wait for the script to continue.

The script does not book the appointment. You always have to click on "Termin buchen" manually.

This script does not make sense at all, since the appointment is reserved for 20min after selecting it.
